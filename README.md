# ClearFlagsMobile
A Unity Image Effect to reproduce the Clear Flags camera effect for mobile (Android/IOS)

##Make sure that you add the shader to the build:
Edit -> Project Settings -> Graphics:

Always Included Shaders (increase by 1)

click the circle icon to the right of the blank array slot and select "Hidden/ClearFlagsImageEffect"


If you don't do this, you will get a black screen when the scene with the camera which has the effect is loaded once deployed to IOS/Android
